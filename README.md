<h1>Map Thumbnail Pack addon</h1>
<p>
This is a small addon for Garry's Mod that I made, which adds map thumbnails to some maps that don't have them.<br>
I hope to make this as a project where anyone can suggest or even add a thumbnail for any map they wish!<br>
<b>Get the addon <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3031841980">here</a>.</b>
</p>
<h1>Current map list</h1>
<p>You can see the maplist <a href="https://github.com/norbcodes/MapThumbnailPack/blob/master/maplist.md">here</a>.</p>
<h1>Map removal</h1>
<p>
If you're a map maker and wish me to delete a thumbnail made for your map, you can make a new "Issue"<br>
on the githup page, or shoot me a message on Steam :)

<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>
As I said, I hope to make this an addon where multiple people can make a thumbnail for any map,<br>
to contribute to this addon, you can:
<ol type=1>
    <li>
    <b>Create a Pull Request</b><br>
    Simply fork this repository, add your thumbnail into maps/thumb/ (following this guideline), and then create a Pull Request!<br>This is the fastest way to get your thumbnail in the addon.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    <b>Make a suggestion in the "Issues" tab</b><br>
    Simply suggest a map you would like me to make a thumbnail for. This might take some time (especially when i'm busy) but hey you might atleast show me some maps I could potentially like :P
    </li>
</ol>
