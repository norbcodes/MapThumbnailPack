<h1>Map thumbnail guidelines</h1>
<p>Now of course I have no authority on map thumbnails, but if you want to see yours in this addon<br>
follow these guidelines:</p>
<ol type=1>
    <li>
    <b>Maximum size should be a 1024x1024 PNG image, thought you can make it smaller if you wish.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Make sure it is straight to the point. Make it highlight a land mark or a location within the map.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Following guideline number 2, you can make an image in photoshop or whatever you like, it doesn't need to be the map itself, but make sure it's still relevant to it.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>No NSFW, obviously.</b>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>I guess that's all :)</p>
